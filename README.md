#Petster

##A place to share pictures of your pet, or any cute animal.

* Post your own pictures, or pictures you find online.

* Add captions to describe the picture.

* Delete pictures you posted, but what to get rid of.

* Be able to see what others have posted.

* Be able to use tags to search what kind of picture you want to see.

* It is going to use imgur ids, much like the Mr Worldwide demo app.

* Think of Instagram, but with animals.

* Take a look at my Trello to see my progress and ideas: <a href ="https://trello.com/b/gyhMlRtg/project2-petster-app">Progress</a>
